      <p>
        For the last year, we have been working from our homes. Some people were
        not ready for this: they didnâ€™t have a dedicated space for working, or
        some of them had a very casual space for only a couple of hours a day.
        It is my intention with this post to motivate you to set a dedicated,
        productive workstation so you can finish your work on time and not
        suffer during the process. If you are working at your dining table with
        a bad chair, you will probably get distracted more often and will find
        your job a little boring because you are just not comfortable at your
        table, and getting a new desk with cool gadgets will make the same work
        more fun.
